=== Individual Muscle Calibration Tool ===
This will calibrate each muscle channel individually for optimal accuracy

First, let's measure your baseline (relaxed state)...

Step 1: Stay completely relaxed for 5 seconds...
Keep all muscles relaxed, don't touch any pins.

Measuring baseline - stay completely relaxed!
âœ“ RightPec baseline: 1835
âœ“ LeftPec baseline: 1837
âœ“ RightQuad baseline: 1822
âœ“ LeftLeg baseline: 1832

Now we'll calibrate each muscle individually...
